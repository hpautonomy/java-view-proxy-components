# View Proxy Components

This library exposes components useful for proxying the Micro Focus Haven OnDemand view document API through a Java web app, 
including utilities for making this more secure. It is designed with Spring MVC in mind, primarily for use in
[Micro Focus Find](https://github.com/microfocus-idol/find).
